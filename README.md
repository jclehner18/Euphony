# Euphony
This program was developed as a senior design project by John Lehner, Jacob Myers, and Darius Surgenevic.

Euphony is a communications application taking inspiration from current applications, such as Discord and Zoom. Euphony is designed as an application for classrooms and organizations with added administrative features such as a calendar system and user management systems to provide administrators with the tools to manage their group.
